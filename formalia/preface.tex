This project is written as first semester thesis of the Master's program in the Mathematics-Economics degree at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University. It is compiled during the autumn semester of 2018. 

When writing a stochastic processes we index over the natural numbers unless it is otherwise specified, we therefore omit the index set in the notation, that is we simply write $\{X_t\}$. Also, we do not necessarily use capital letters to denote random variables, as it should be clear from the context. If a mathematical proof does not bring any insight for the project, we simply omit the proof. Lastly, the significance level for all tests conducted in this project is at a $0.05$ level. 

All programming in this project is performed with \rfontblack{R (v.3.5)}, where we use the \rfont{rugarch} package for the model fitting, forecasting, and most of the testing. 

The code library can be found at the following link

Finally, we would like to extend our appreciation to our supervisor, Nima Nonejad.
